        <div class="s_h1">Winter Heart Health – When the Season Turns Cold, Let Your Care Stay Warm</div>

        <p class="s_para para-margin">Winter brings relief in many ways, but for the heart, it can become an unexpectedly demanding season. As temperatures drop, medical records consistently show a rise in heart attacks, sudden cardiac arrest, BP spikes, and breathlessness. Even those who usually feel strong and healthy may notice subtle changes-slower stamina, heavier breathing, or a quiet pressure in the chest that wasn't there before. These small shifts can feel easy to brush aside, yet they are often the heart's first whisper that it is struggling.</p>

        <p class="s_para para-margin">If you begin sensing these changes, please don't ignore them. A timely visit to our experienced cardiology team can offer clarity, reassurance, and the care your heart needs to stay protected through the winter months. Your wellbeing matters, and early action can make all the difference.</p>

A timely heart evaluation can identify hidden issues such as early coronary blockages, heart muscle weakness, rhythm disturbances, blood pressure instability, fluid overload, and lung–heart interaction problems.</p>
