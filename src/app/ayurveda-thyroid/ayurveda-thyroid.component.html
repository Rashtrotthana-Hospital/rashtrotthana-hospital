            <p class="a_para">In Ayurvedic literature, thyroid disorders are referred to as “Galaganda”, with ‘Gala’
                meaning throat and ‘Ganda’ signifying swelling or a lump. The thyroid, linked to the throat chakra,
                plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism, hormones, and overall body functions. Ayurveda associates
                thyroid imbalances with disruptions in the 'Vata' dosha and offers a holistic treatment approach using
                natural herbal medications and lifestyle adjustments to stabilize hormones and restore balance. Thyroid
                disorders arise from inadequate hormone production, leading to conditions like hyperthyroidism,
                characterized by weight loss, muscle weakness, and sleep disturbances, or hypothyroidism, which causes
                weight gain, depression, and fatigue. Globally, thyroid disease affects over 200 million people, with
                women being significantly more prone due to hormonal changes during pregnancy and menopause. Ayurveda
                provides a natural, effective way to manage thyroid conditions by addressing the root causes and
                promoting long-term health.</p>

                <ul style="padding: 0;">
                    <li class="a_para para_margin"><b>Role of Iodine : </b>The thyroid gland produces hormones essential
                        for maintaining the body’s metabolism and overall health. Iodine is a key component required by
                        the thyroid gland to produce these hormones. Dysfunction of the thyroid gland, combined with
                        insufficient iodine intake, can lead to health issues such as goiter and hypothyroidism.</li>
                    <li class="a_para para_margin"><b>Stress : </b>Stress significantly impacts thyroid function by
                        disrupting hormone production. Prolonged stress can increase cortisol levels, a stress hormone
                        that interferes with the production of thyroid hormones. This imbalance may affect the metabolic
                        rate and overall well-being, exacerbating thyroid disorders.</li>
                    <li class="a_para para_margin"><b>Variation in Gland Function : </b>Thyroid disorders often
                        originate from variations in gland functionality. If the gland fails to produce sufficient
                        hormones, it results in imbalances that contribute to conditions such as hypothyroidism or
                        hyperthyroidism, which affect metabolism and essential bodily processes.</li>
                    <li class="a_para para_margin"><b>Pituitary Gland Malfunction : </b>The pituitary gland regulates
                        thyroid hormone production by releasing the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). A malfunction in
                        the pituitary gland leads to inadequate TSH production, which disrupts thyroid function and
                        negatively impacts energy levels, metabolism, and other essential processes.</li>
                    <li class="a_para para_margin"><b>Hormonal Imbalance : </b>Hormonal imbalances are a leading cause
                        of thyroid disorders, particularly in women. Life stages such as puberty, pregnancy, and
                        menopause bring significant hormonal changes that can impact thyroid function. This fluctuation
                        in hormones often results in thyroid-related conditions that influence energy and metabolism.

                    <li class="a_para para_margin"><b>Fatigue : </b>Insufficient thyroid hormones slow down metabolism,
                        reducing energy levels and causing fatigue. This often results in lethargy and unexplained
                        weight gain.</li>
                    <li class="a_para para_margin"><b>Weight Fluctuations : </b>Imbalances in thyroid hormones can lead
                        to significant weight changes. Hypothyroidism, characterized by reduced hormone secretion, often
                        causes weight gain, while hyperthyroidism, with excessive hormone production, results in weight
                        loss.</li>
                    <li class="a_para para_margin"><b>Mood Swings : </b>Thyroid disorders influence emotional
                        well-being. Hypothyroidism may lead to depression, sadness, and lethargy, while hyperthyroidism
                        is often associated with anxiety, irritability, and restlessness.</li>
                    <li class="a_para para_margin"><b>Difficulty Concentrating : </b>Commonly seen in hypothyroidism, a
                        lack of thyroid hormones can cause brain fog, reduced focus, and mild memory issues, affecting
                        daily productivity.</li>
                    <li class="a_para para_margin"><b>Muscle Weakness : </b>Thyroid dysfunction affects muscle energy
                        and strength. Insufficient thyroid hormones, particularly in hypothyroidism, result in weakened
                        muscles and discomfort due to slowed metabolism.</li>
                    <li class="a_para para_margin"><b>Sleep Disturbances : </b>Disrupted sleep cycles are a common issue
                        in thyroid disorders. Hypothyroidism may interfere with the body’s circadian rhythm, causing
                        difficulty falling or staying asleep, while daytime sleepiness is also frequent.
