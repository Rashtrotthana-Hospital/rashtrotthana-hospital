            <p class="con_1_para">Ayurveda has been offering a complete holistic health care to people since ages. Rather than medications it offers a lot including diet and lifestyle. Supreme Scholar of Ayurveda - Acharya Charaka opines that the objective of ayurveda is to maintain positive health of a healthy person and to cure the disease of the patient.The concept of ‘being in balance’ is an integral and the core principle in Ayurveda. Perfect health, according to Ayurveda, is a balance between the body, mind, soul and social wellbeing. The Sanskrit word for health, ‘svastha’, is a state in which the mind, body and soul interact harmoniously to experience a feeling of self, wellness and even bliss. This state of the body and mind happens only when the 3 doshas - Vata, Pitta, Kapha are in balance or in your original constituent state. Ayurveda aims at getting this state of swasthya by making use of elegant, insightful and effective tools and techniques, easily and effortlessly.</p>

May it be the treatment for the individual or may it be the prevention and rejuvenation for the community. It is based on the principle that a healthy individual makes a healthy family, a healthy family makes a Healthy community, a healthy community makes a healthy society and healthy society makes a strong nation. It caters to all health needs of the society such as cure or regression in disease condition, purification in chronic illnesses, promotion of health in healthy individuals. Thus 8 branch of Ayurveda that is Kayachikitsa (Internal medicine), Bala chikitsa (Pediatrics), Graha Chikitsa (Psychiatric and Psychosomatic treatment), Shalakya (Diseases of neck and above part), Shalya chikitsa (Surgical Intervention), Agada(Toxicology), Jara (Rejuvenation) Vrushya (Reproductive medicine). These are the eight branches which aid the complete health of a person. In recent years, Ayurveda has gained attention worldwide, leading to increased research and scientific exploration of its principles and practices. Though science existed for thousands of years there are many things that are lost and extinct, such as literature and practices. Which creates some vacuum. This vacuum has the potential to unlock new insights and integrate Ayurvedic knowledge with modern health care practices.</p>
