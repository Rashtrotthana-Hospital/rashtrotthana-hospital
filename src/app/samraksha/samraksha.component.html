        <div class="para" style="margin-top: -10px;"><b>A Haven for the Patients</b><br />I travel all the way from West
            Bengal for my blood transfusions because, back home, hospitals ask me to arrange a blood donor every time.
            It was exhausting and stressful. But here, at the Samraksha Project, everything is taken care of by the
            hospital itself. I don't have to worry about anything. The environment is peaceful, and the staff is kind
            and supportive. I finally feel safe and cared for, without the constant fear of where my next transfusion
            will come from.</div>
        <div class="para"><b>A Second Home After Betrayal</b><br />After the death of my shauhar (husband), my own son
            abandoned me and my daughter, who suffers from thalassemia. We were left with no shelter, no support, and no
            hope. But then, the Samraksha Project embraced us with open arms. Here, we found not just medical care but
            also the warmth of a family. I will always remain grateful to the people behind this initiative, who proved
            that humanity still exists in this world.</div>
        <div class="para"><b>A Lifeline in My Darkest Days</b><br />Losing my father left me completely helpless. I had
            no one to turn to, and survival itself became a challenge. That's when the Samraksha Project became my
            biggest support. They not only provide me with free blood transfusions and essential medicines but also
            ensure that I don't go hungry by offering breakfast and lunch. More than medical care, they gave me dignity
            and hope. Without Samraksha, I don't know how I would have survived.</div>
        <div class="para"><b>A Mother's Unbreakable Spirit</b><br />When my father married another woman, he told my
            mother to let me die because he couldn't afford my treatment. But my mother refused to give up on me, She
            started washing utensils in other people's houses just to afford my medical expenses. Then, she found out
            about the Samraksha Project, and everything changed. Now, I receive free treatment, blood transfusions, and
            care without any financial burden. The kindness of this place has given my mother and me a new life. I will
            forever be grateful to the team at Samraksha for standing with us when no one else did.</div>
