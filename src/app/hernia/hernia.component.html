    <p class="con_2_head_txt">What is a Hernia?</p>
    <p class="para_txt">A hernia occurs when an organ or tissue protrudes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle or connective tissue. This can result in a noticeable bulge, often in the abdomen or groin area. Sometimes you can see the hernia, depending on its location and size.</p>
</div>

<div class="container_2 .container_2_responsive">
    <p class="con_2_head_txt">Hernia Causes:</p>
    <p class="para_txt">The various types of hernias can have different causes. In general, a hernia starts with pressure on an organ or your intestines. When this pressure occurs in the same area as a weakened muscle or tissue, a hernia forms. Some people are born with weak muscles or tissue that isnâ€™t fully developed. However, most people get hernias as their bodies age and their muscles weaken.</p>

        <p class="con_5_para_1">At Rashtrotthana Hospital, our approach to hernia treatment is tailored to the type of hernia you have and your overall health. Initially, your doctor may recommend monitoring your condition for any changes, which may involve adjustments to your diet, activity levels and daily habits. Medications can also help alleviate hernia symptoms.</p>
        <p class="con_5_para_2">If the hernia does not improve or worsens, your doctor will discuss surgical options. There are two main types of surgical treatments available: </p>
        <p class="con_5_heading_2">Laparoscopic Surgery: </p>
        <p class="con_5_para_3">Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure where the surgeon makes small incisions in the affected area to repair the hernia. This technique typically results in less pain and a quicker recovery time compared to traditional surgery.</p>
        <p class="con_5_heading_3">Open Repair Surgery: </p>
        <p class="con_5_para_4">Open repair surgery involves making a larger incision to access and repair the hernia. This method may be necessary for larger or more complex hernias.</p>
